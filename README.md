# CasparHealthBDD

My configuration details : MacOS, Chrome web driver, Eclipse with java, selenium and junit, maven, cucumber

Here I have set up a basic structure of BDD solution. The Stepdefs.java can directly call the steps in CasparHealth/CasparHealthAutomation/src/Test/FunctionalTests/TaskUserFlowTest.java from https://github.com/tejsmiles/CasparHealth and use the same Page Object Model code that I have set up. This set up would be more interesting from Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment point of view in addition to behaviour driven development.
